# ARetail: Generating 3D furniture

ARetail is developed by a team from NUS High: `Ang Kang Rong, Roy`, `Kyle Zheng Ching Chan` and `Andrew Yapp Wei Rong`

ARetail will represent Singapore at Asian Pacific ICT Alliance 2019 in Vietnam from 19-23 Nov, in the Student Category.

## Project Description
ARetail incorporates a pre-trained Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) and Augmented Reality (AR). The GAN takes a 2D image of a furniture as input, and generates a 3D model of that furniture based on what can be derived from the photo and the computer's understanding of the furniture from training data.

The generated 3D model can then be positioned in AR for realistic interior design on mobile phones.

ARetail can generate 3D models for the billions of online furniture listings and can help consumers view furniture in their own home before buying them.
